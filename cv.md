## About Me:
Moving into the IT industry is about constantly learning and growing. What I just lacked in the same place.
Python was not chosen by chance, a programming language with simple syntax and semantics provided fast learning and helped develop algorithmic thinking.
I am currently taking a course at RS School on JS/Front-end. stage 0

From a hobby: mountain hiking will be the most important.
After all, "Only mountains can be better than mountains,
Which I haven't been to yet..."
